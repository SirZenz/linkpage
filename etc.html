<main>
    <h2>Symbols</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p><strong>Pigs:</strong> Represent the struggle between nature and domesticity, as well as the primal instincts within the characters. The narrator reflects, <em>"Still, there’s something obscene about pig hunting – chasing boars through the bush with snarling muscular dogs."</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>Glow-worms:</strong> Symbolize hidden beauty and the duality of light and darkness in life. Upon discovering them, the narrator notes, <em>"An entire world hidden under our noses."</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>Food:</strong> Reflects nurturing, survival, and the connection to the land and family. The narrator describes cooking, stating, <em>"I’d cooked a huge stew; beans and tomato, kale and carrots... Autumn surprise, I called it."</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>The Rifle:</strong> Represents power, control, desperation, and the act of taking life. When she decides to hunt, she admits, <em>"I hoisted the rifle over my shoulder, released the safety and shot."</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>Wild Pigs:</strong> Symbolize both a threat to the family’s livelihood and the narrator's inner turmoil and conflict. She thinks, <em>"I thought about the pig all day –... the image of blood blooming in the slit."</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>The Guava Tree:</strong> Represents home, connection to the land, and the disruption caused by outside threats. The narrator observes, <em>"Loose maroon bruises of empty skins were scattered at the base of the guava."</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>Bread:</strong> Symbolizes nourishment, care, routine, stability, connection to the land, and transformation. She recalls, <em>"after an hour in the oven, brown and high, folding over the edge of the tin."</em></p>
    </div>

    <h2>Themes</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p><strong>Absence and Loss:</strong> The impact of Paul’s disappearance on the family is profound. The narrator reflects, <em>"I didn’t want to tell them until I was sure he wasn’t coming back."</em> This highlights her struggle with uncertainty.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Nature vs. Nurture:</strong> The balance between living close to the land and the responsibilities of family life is evident when she states, <em>"We’re not farmers, but we live close to the land."</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>Gender Roles:</strong> The expectations placed on characters based on gender are revealed through the hunting dynamics: <em>"He would, too. Paul knows how to fix things."</em> This illustrates traditional roles in the family.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Family Dynamics:</strong> The impact of a parent's absence is explored when Bo asks, <em>"Where’s Dad?"</em> This moment underscores the children's confusion and longing.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Isolation and Loneliness:</strong> The narrator's feelings of isolation are captured in her thoughts: <em>"It gets dark early, without the sodium glow of the city."</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>Nature and Hunting:</strong> The ethics of hunting are questioned as she reflects on the violence: <em>"It’s tough, pig-skin. It takes more force than you think."</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>Betrayal and Trust:</strong> The narrator’s anxiety about her husband’s fidelity is palpable when she thinks about his absence, <em>"Like Cook, like Heke, like we all are in the end, I suppose."</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>Identity and Belonging:</strong> The family's adjustment to rural life is evident when she recalls their move: <em>"When we moved here, after the first lockdown, we couldn’t believe our luck."</em></p>
    </div>

    <h2>Settings</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p><strong>Rural Landscape:</strong> The setting emphasizes isolation, as the narrator notes, <em>"Driving up the metal road, forestry blocks either side tunnelling away the view."</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>Family Home:</strong> Represents safety, as she reflects on their new space: <em>"The kids settled in fine, is what I am saying."</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>Orchards and Creeks:</strong> Symbolize the beauty of the natural world, with the narrator observing, <em>"The air was cooler in the spruce-lined orchard."</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>Rural Property:</strong> A remote farm that emphasizes themes of isolation, described as <em>"the denuded hillside, recently harvested slash down its face like an acned teenager."</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>Evening and Night:</strong> The darkness creates tension, as the narrator states, <em>"When you turn on the light, the glass turns to mirror and all you can see is your own worried face."</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>Inside the House:</strong> Represents domestic life, capturing the routine: <em>"I reheated Garden Surprise, cutting off fat hunks of bread and spreading them with bright yellow butter."</em></p>
